This file contains instructions for installing Algraeph from a binary
distribution under Mac OS X or MS Windows, or from source (assuming
GNU Linux by default).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mac OS X binary distribution
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tested on Mac OS X version 10.6 (Snow Leopard).


Install Graphviz
----------------

Algraeph requires a command line program called "dot" from the Graphviz graph
visualization software (http://www.graphviz.org/). You have two options:

Option 1 (recommended): Install a Graphviz binary package 

   Download and install the current stable release of Graphviz for Mac OS X 
   from http://www.graphviz.org/Download_macos.php

Option 2: Install Graphviz from source

   Install Graphviz from a package management system such as MacPorts or Fink,
   or build directly from source.

   For example, if you have MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/), you can
   install graphviz with the command:

   sudo port install graphviz +no_x11

   IMPORTANT: Make sure that the "dot" executable is in your /usr/bin
   directory. Either create a symbolic link or copy it to /usr/bin/dot.
   (Algraeph.app runs in a system-wide environment without reading your
   .profile or .bashrc, so adding to PATH does not help).

   For example, if you installed with MacPorts, create a symbolic link (
   /usr/bin/dot) to the real dot program (/opt/local/bin/dot) by opening a
   terminal window and typing:

   sudo ln -s /opt/local/bin/dot /usr/bin/dot

   (you must supply your superuser password for this)



Install Algraeph
----------------

1. Download the file algraeph_1.0_mac-os-x.zip from https://github.com/emsrc/algraeph.

2. Double click on the file algraeph_1.0_mac-os-x.zip to unzip the archive. 

3. Move the newly created folder algraeph_1.0_mac-os-x to a convenient location
   (e.g., your home folder).

4. Optionally move the application Algraeph from the algraeph_1.0_mac-os-x folder 
   to your Applications folder.



Testing Algraeph
----------------

1. Double click on the application Algraeph

2. Choose Open from the File menu, go to the 
   algraeph_1.0_mac-os-x/data/graphml/simple directory, 
   and open the file algraeph-simple-alignment.xml After loading is finished, 
   you should see two aligned trees for the sentences "spam and eggs" and 
   "smac en eieren".


Uninstall Algraeph
------------------ 

1. Delete the folder algraeph_1.0_mac-os-x and all of its contents.

2. If present, delete the application Algraeph from your Applications folder.

Tested on MS Windows XP.


Install Graphviz
----------------

Algraeph requires the command line program called "dot" from the
Graphviz graph visualization software (http://www.graphviz.org/). Please
download and install the latest version for MS Wndows from
http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php


Install Algraeph
----------------

1. Download the file setup-algraeph-1.0.exe from http://daeso.uvt.nl/algraeph

2. Double click on the file setup-algraeph-1.0.exe to run the
   installer, and you will be guided through the installation proces.


Testing Algraeph
----------------

1. From Start menu, continue to the Program submenu, on to the
   Algraeph submenu, and choose Algraeph.

2. Choose Open from the File menu, go to the directory
   data\graphml\simple, and open the file
   algraeph-simple-alignment.xml. After loading is finished, you should
   see two aligned trees for the sentences "spam and eggs" and "smac
   en eieren".


Uninstall Algraeph
------------------

1. Open the "Control Panel" from the "Start" menu

2. Double click "Add or Remove Software"

3. Select Algraeph-1.0 and click the button "Remove"


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Source distribution (GNU Linux)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tested on Ubuntu Linux 9.10


Installation requirements
-------------------------

Algraeph has the following dependencies:

1. Python (tested with version 2.6)
   available from http://www.python.org/

2. wxPython (tested with version 2.8.10)
   available from http://www.wxpython.org/

4. "dot" command line program from Graphviz (tested with version 2.26)
   available from http://www.graphviz.org/

5. NetworkX (tested with version 1.0)
   available from https://networkx.lanl.gov/

6. The DAESO Python Framework availabe from
   https://github.com/emsrc/daeso-framework

7. The DAESO Dutch Python libraries available from 
   https://github.com/emsrc/daeso-dutch

Notice that the first five of these may already be present on your system, or
may be easily installed through a package manager. Although untested, Algraeph
is likely to work correctly with (slightly) older versions of Python, wxPython
and Graphviz (NetworkX must be 1.0 or higher though).


Install Algraeph
----------------

1. Download the source archive in your preferred format (e.g. algraeph-1.0.tar.gz) 
   from https://github.com/emsrc/algraeph/wiki/Python-Packages

2. Unpack (e.g. tar xvzf algraeph-1.0.tar.gz) in a suitable location
   (e.g. /usr/local/src)

3. Change directory to the root of the unpacked archive 
   (e.g. cd algraeph-1.0)

4. Install using the command

   python setup.py -v install

   You probably need to be root or administrator to be allowed to do a
   system-wide install. For more information (alternative install locations,
   trouble shooting, etc) see "Installing Pyton Modules" at
   http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html

   You can check the ouput of the preceding setup.py command to see to
   which directory the main script algraeph.py was copied. Normally,
   this will be a directory like /usr/bin, which is already in your
   search path. If not, make sure you add this directory to your search
   path or to copy algraeph.py to another directory in your search path.

   The documentation (in directory "doc") goes to a directory
   sys.prefix/share/algraeph-1.0/doc and the examples (in directory
   "data") to sys.prefix/share/algraeph-0-.6.x/doc, where the value of
   sys.prefix depends on your Python installation. On Linux, this will
   often be /usr/share, but it may be different on your platform. To
   find out, type the following at the shell command line:

   python -c "import sys; print sys.prefix"

5. Optional: remove the unpacked archive


Testing Algraeph
----------------

1. Start Algraeph from the command line by typing "algraeph.py"

2. Open the file algraeph-simple-alignment.xml in the directory
   sys.prefix/share/algraeph-1.0/data/graphml/simple/ After loading
   is finished, you should see two aligned trees for the sentences
   "spam and eggs" and "smac en eieren".


Uninstall Algraeph
------------------

1. Remove the directories for the "graeph" and "daeso" packages from
   Python's site-packages directory

2. Remove algraeph.py from Python's bin or scripts directory; 
   see step 4 of the installation.

3. Remove the"doc" and "data" from the shared files directory; 
   see step 4 of the installation.
